v0.2.2-dor1:
------------
In prev. versions there were wrong data (8 times greater) stored as rate and
ceil values into RRD database. So, after installing this version, prev. rate
and ceil values will appear too little. All next updates will store correct
values.


v0.2.1:
-------
If you "upgrade" to v0.2.1 from any previous version, you should rename old
bases -- new ones will be named with full classid (in form of `xxxx:xxxx`).
